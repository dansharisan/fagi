FAGI stands for Fear And Greed Index, is a hobby project I made for learning NextJS while also could build something useful for my interest as well.
As the name states, it provides Fear and Greed index for crypto and US stock markets, that hopefully will help us to made better decisions on crypto/stock investment.

The app can be accessed here:

Hope you will enjoy it :)
